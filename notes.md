# Use-Cases

From the brainstorming list:
- DNS current uses and use cases so that proposals can be evaluated to score what works/what breaks
- Capture any territorial compliance/legal requirements
- Is there a way to express the requirements that would allow compliance to such laws to be expressed in a privacy statement without listing all territories (this could be a table that network operators fill in)
