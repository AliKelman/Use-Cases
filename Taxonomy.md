# Introduction

This area documents a common set of terminology to be referenced by the use cases, initially populated from Hugh Dixon's User Taxonomy (spotter's guide).

For each role, we will provide:

* Role identifier (with a prefix that reflects its broad category and legitimacy)
* Short name (a more human readable version of the role identifier)
* Long name (that clearly articulates what it is)
* Description

Proposed categories are a combination of:
* Individual (acting for themselves)
* Organization (or individuals acting for the organization)
* Device (executing code defined by the software authors)

and:
* Legitimate (generally seen as good and valid in at least some contexts)
* Borderline (less consensus - wanted by some roles but not by others)
* Illegitimate (generally seen as something that should not be allowed)

We should define single-letter codes for the above.

## Note well

Users are very often more than one type, e.g.:
* Same device but both mobile and fixed-line broadband internet access customers
* Parent, employee and adult individual at different times of day.
* One man’s terrorist is another’s freedom fighter
Users have varying priorities between privacy, security and practicality, probably within the same day.
