## Encrypted DNS IoT user cases/considerations:
 
### Main categories of IoT:
·         Basic M2M / IoT devices with limited functionality so likely to only be able to support Do53.
·         Latest IoT devices particularly smart home devices which could support DoT and DoH going forward.
 
### IoT sub use cases:
IoT device operate in a great many environments, each with unqiue and diverse architectures for network and DNS services

#### Smart Home
#### Smart Cities
#### Smart Buildings
#### Smart Assets
#### Smart Vehicles
#### Industrial / Enterprise
#### Healthcare
 
## Questions for IoT devices capable of encrypted DNS:
#### Choice of DoT vs DoH on device
#### Whether home hubs / CPE should support local DoT / DoH proxy/stub
#### Core network support for DoT/DoH IoT resolvers – whether separate DNS resolvers will be required for certain categories of IoT devices (e.g. healthcare) for added resilience and security.
#### How to handle GDPR / informed consent aspects if no easy user interface.
